# host

Sometimes we need to bind the domain to a fixed ip address, we can add some configuration in the hosts file of the os.

> You can get the real ip of the address, hostname or domain from [this site](https://www.ipaddress.com/). If you can access the real ip, the configuration will take effect.

## path of the file `hosts`

- For windows, the path maybe `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.
- For Linux/macOS, the path is `/etc/hosts`.
